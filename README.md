# CS230-Data-Structures-Linked-Lists
Link List project fulfilling multiple requirements

Project Problem Domain:

Write a program that tracks faculty's information, such as id,  names, rank, and number of allowed courses if the faculty is an adjunct. The hierarchy will be based on an abstract class Faculty and two derived classes, Professor and Adjunct.

For this project, you will store all instances of faculty in a linked list!

Have your program allow the user to enter records, display all records, find a record, and delete a record.  Those options should be displayed in a menu at run time.
